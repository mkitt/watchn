    <h1>watchn</h1>
    <p>Intelligently and continuously auto execute tasks on file/directory changes. File watching on steroids.</p>
    <p>Watchn aims to automate the repetitive tasks developers run throughout the day. Tasks such as running tests, generating documentation, concatenating and minifying files. You know all those tasks we hammer together inside a Makefile, Rakefile, Jakefile or even Ant (cringe) tasks. In fact hooking into these files is exactly what it's designed for. Watchn is really an elaborate file/directory watcher and directs it's notifications into callbacks defined by the User. Watchn is designed to run in the background so you can write your code and don't have to leave your current window to run the build scripts or tests. Watchn can be as quiet or as loud as you want it to be. It's really up to the User to define what your preference is and what watchn executes on.</p>
    <p>Watchn does some fancy code reloading, so it knows when you add a file/directory, remove a file/directory, or even update the runner file you've setup to hook into your tasks.</p>
